## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or higher
*   Apache Maven 3.x
*   PostgreSQL database server
*   A web browser to access the frontend

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Railway-Booking.git
    cd Railway-Booking/Railway-Ticket-Booking-System
    ```

2.  **Configure PostgreSQL:**
    *   Create a PostgreSQL database (e.g., `railway_db`).
    *   Update the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file with your PostgreSQL database credentials. (Note: This file is currently a binary in the provided context, you'll need to create or modify it with your database configuration).
        ```properties
        spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/railway_db
        spring.datasource.username=your_username
        spring.datasource.password=your_password
        spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
        spring.jpa.show-sql=true
        spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
        ```
    *   You might also want to add a `data.sql` file in `src/main/resources` to pre-populate some train data for testing.

3.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean install
    ```
